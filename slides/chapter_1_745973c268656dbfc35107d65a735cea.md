Welcome to the course! My name is Michel, and this is the sample screencast for the SQL for Business course. In this video, you’ll learn how to calculate revenue and cost.

Before doing that, though, let’s cover the prerequisites and objectives for the course.

## Prerequisites and objectives

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5d3b80addf"
```

`@part1`
**Prerequisites**:
- SELECT (WHERE, GROUP BY) 
- JOIN

**Objectives**:
- Learn advanced concepts in SQL (such as CTEs and window functions)
- Use them to answer business-related questions and calculate key metrics


`@script`
You should be comfortable with SELECT statements in SQL, namely how to filter records in the WHERE clause and how to aggregate records using GROUP BY. Going through Intro to SQL for Data Science for the former and Joining Data in PostgreSQL for the latter on DataCamp should put you in a good position.

In this course, you’re going to learn advanced concepts in SQL, such as Common Table Expressions (known as CTEs) and window functions, and use them to answer business-related questions and calculate key metrics, such as revenue or growth of users.

Now, let’s dive in.

## Retailr

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a3b87e2db9"
```

`@part1`
- Online e-commerce company (think Amazon, Etsy)
- Stores all data in a central SQL database
 - User information (registration date, country, et cetera)
 - Items bought by users
 - Inventory
- Wants to extract insights from data to guide business decisions


`@script`
Throughout the course, we’re going to base our queries on the data of a fictional company called Retailr. Retailr is an online e-commerce platform, similar to Amazon or Etsy. It stores all of its data in a central SQL database. This data can represent anything from user demographics (such as clients’ registration dates and countries), to the items bought by the users, to the items in the company’s inventory. Retailr wants to leverage its data by extracting insights from it to guide their business decisions.

## Profit

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e9616e6a3c"
```

`@part1`
- Is Retailr profitable?
- Profit = Revenue - Cost
 - **Revenue**: The money a company generates (sales, projects, etc)
 - **Cost**: The money a company spends to operate
 - Positive profit means a company is making money
 - Negative profit means a company is losing money


`@script`
The first question one asks about a company is: “Is it profitable?” In other words, if we take all the money that the company pulls in (this is called revenue), and subtract from that all the money that the company spends (this is called cost), is the company left with a positive sum of money?

The formula for profit is profit = revenue - cost. So to calculate profit, we’ll first have to get revenue and cost.

## Revenue

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "523616027c"
```

`@part1`
- Retailr generates revenue by selling items online
 - The price of a USB is $10
 - The price of a cable is $4
 - A user buys 2 USBs and 3 cables
 - Retailr generates 10 x 2 + 4 x 3 = 20 + 12 = $32 in revenue


`@script`
Let’s start with revenue.

Since Retailr is an e-commerce platform, its revenue is the money that its users pay to purchase the items on it. For example, if a USB costs $10 and a cable costs $4, and a user buys 2 USBs and 3 cables, Retailr’s revenue from this purchase is $10 * 2 + $4 * 3 = $20 + $12 = $32. Let’s explore how Retailr stores this data.
